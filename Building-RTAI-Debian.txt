BUILDING RTAI KERNEL, REALTIME and MACHINEKIT on DEBIAN 7 (Wheezy)
------------------------------------------------------------------

This guide is for those who wish to experiment with their own kernel
and realtime builds

The config has been tested sucessfully on D525 Intel Atom, Intel P4,
Intel Celeron B630 and Intel core i2

It does not however run Machinekit on a new Intel core i7, 
albeit the kernel runs and everything builds, so it may not be suitable
for some newer Sandy Bridge chipset and later based boards

                    ************************

There is no need to do this to get a realtime kernel that works on Debian

Simply go to http://highlab.com/~seb/linuxcnc/rtai-for-3.4-prerelease/

Download

*linux-headers-3.4.55-rtai-2_3_i386.deb*

*linux-image-3.4.55-rtai-2_3_i386.deb*

*rtai-modules-3.4.55-rtai-2_3.9-shabby-memleak-2013.12.13_i386.deb*

Install them with *dpkg -i <debname>*

Run *update-grub* and re-boot into the kernel and build MachineKit 
(instructions below if required)

I have tested this and it works fine

The only isssue is that you need to sort out some symlinks

Install the headers first and then make a symlink to them in */usr/src* called *linux*

Install the kernel image and you will see errors from postinst regards the modules
symlinks

Create two symlinks from */usr/src/linux* to */lib/modules/3.4.55-rtai-2/build* and */lib/modules/3.4.55-rtai-2/source*

Now install realtime

Now the path in /realtime-xxxxx/bin/rtai-config for the linux sources will be correct

If you don't do this the MachineKit build will fail to build any rtai modules and fail when run


                  ***************************


.Installing Debian 7 and readying it for Building on i386 PC's
----
----
The best source for an installation is the debian net install CD image

It is small (approx 280MB) and because the bulk of files are downloaded
from the net, the initial installation is always completely up to date.

*http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/*

Then choose whatever the current version of 7 is (currently 7.5)


.Install type
----
There are many options available, you can choose text or graphical install
and from there which window manager etc

LXDM is a good choice for a light install

Choose a kernel type to suit your machine, unless it is an old machine the 
686-pae kernel is a safe choice
----

.Post Install
----
Various things need to be done to ready your system for realtime operation
and building.
----

.Getting root and sudo access
----
----
The Debian install process has a nasty habit of allowing you to create a 
root account and set a password during install, but when you boot the install
you cannot access root and sudo does not work

This often seems to result from allowing the installer to set time from
internet and when you come to complete the install it hangs half way trying to
resolve the time and never creates the root account properly.
I don't let it set the time like this and just choose time zone and adjust for
summertime etc myself later.

If this affects you, the below will enable you to get root a	rtai-modules-3.4.55-rtai-2_3.9-shabby-memleak-2013.12.13_i386.debccess and sudo as a user.

This assumes you chose GRUB 2 as the boot manager.  If you chose Lilo - good luck

Reboot and interrupt the grub boot, (hold down ESC if you never see it to get it up, 
you may need to use a PS2 keyboard with older BIOS)
and press 'e' on the boot line

Go to the kernel boot line and change the end bit from 'ro quiet splash' to 'ro single'
Then press F10 to boot or Esc will take you back to the menu without change if you think
you have fouled up and want to start again.

That will get you a root shell

*passwd root*

Enter new password twice

*passwd -u root*

then reboot

From the root terminal (Accessories > Root Terminal if using LXDM)

*apt-get install gedit*  (does not get installed by default)

*gedit /etc/sudoers*

Beneath entry for root enter

*dave    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL*
(assuming your user is dave)

Save and close the terminal

Open another one and you should be able to sudo 


.Fetch build packages
---- 
----
First fetch the following using apt from a terminal
(This will take some considerable time)

*sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper libpth-dev libgtk2.0-dev tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev*

*sudo apt-get install bwidget python-old-doctools python-tk python-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgnomeprintui2.2-dev*

*sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libxaw7-dev gettext libreadline-gplv2-dev lyx texlive-extra-utils imagemagick texinfo groff libmodbus-dev*

*sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libmodbus-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev*

*sudo apt-get install libtk-img automake autoconf libtool libusb-0.1-4 libusb-1.0.0-dev git*


This list is not exhaustive but correct at the time of writing.
It is possible that extra packages will be required in the future or that package numbers will change.
You will be prompted during the configure process of building MachineKit if any more are required.

Sometimes it will not be until you come to run MachineKit that extra python requirements will
become known, but that is the nature of a run-time language.

.Fetching the sources for kernel and realtime
----
----
In the root terminal run

*cd /usr/src*

*git clone https://github.com/arceye/3.5.7-rtai-debian.git sources*

.Building the kernel
----
----
When finished cloning

*cp -R sources/RTAI RTAI*

*cp -R sources/linux-3.5.7 linux-3.5.7*

*ln -s linux-3.5.7 linux*

*cd linux*

*patch -p1 < ../sources/hal-linux-3.5.7-x86-3.patch*

For a SMP (multi processor) build

*cp ../sources/3.5.7-rtai-smp-config .config*

Or for a UP (single processor) build

*cp ../sources/3.5.7-rtai-up-config .config*

*touch .config*

At this point you could make changes to the config with *make menuconfig*

Do so at your own risk, setting the correct number of cores is probably the most you want to do
if it is more than 4 (SMP config only)

If you start changing the processor instruction set or turning back on ACPI functions in particular
you could end up with a kernel that does not run at all, or does not run realtime apps.

To turn on the production of a driver module you require for your machine, it is often easier to
search the config file in an editor

*DRIVER_NAME=y*  means it will be built into the kernel

*DRIVER_NAME=m*  means it will be built as a module

Now build the kernel
 
*make -jX*  (where X is the number of cores + 1 on a multi-core machine, or just)

*make* (on a UP machine)

When finished (may take a long time)

*make modules_install*

*cp System.map /boot/System.map-3.5.7-rtai*

*cp .config /boot/config-3.5.7-rtai*

*cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.7-rtai*

*cd /boot*

*update-initramfs -c -k 3.5.7-rtai*

*update-grub*


.Rebooting to the 3.5.7-rtai kernel
----
----

You are then ready to reboot and select the 3.5.7-rtai kernel from the GRUB menu.


.Building Realtime
----
----

Open a root terminal

*cd /usr/src/RTAI*

*./autogen.sh*

configure will run, but now you need to edit the default RTAI configuration

*make menuconfig*

    From here you need to go to Base System > Other features  [Enter] and select
        (Y) Mathfuns support in Kernel                  
	    (Y) C99 standard support                        
	
    You must configure RTAI for your specific number of processing cores

		To find out how many cores your CPU has, run:
		cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l 
		in another terminal              
		
		Then got Machine > Number of CPUs, [Enter] and replace figure with your number

		Finally press <Exit> until out of menuconfig and say <Yes> to save config   

Now configure will run again automatically    

*make && make install*

When finished, that is realtime installed  

.Create and Edit config files for realtime / machinekit
---- 
----

From a terminal

*sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/50-LINUXCNC-shmdrv.rules*

*sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/50-LINUXCNC-shmdrv.rules*

make this entry
[source,bash]
----
# make the shared memory allocator publically accessible
KERNEL=="shmdrv", MODE="0666"
----

*sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/99-rtai.rules*

*sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-rtai.rules*

make these entries
[source,bash]
----
# RTAI:rtai_shm
KERNEL=="rtai_shm", MODE="0666"

# RTAI:rtai_fifos
KERNEL=="rtf[0-9]*", MODE="0666"
----

*sudo touch /etc/security/limits.d/linuxcnc.conf*

*sudo gedit /etc/security/limits.d/linuxcnc.conf*

make these entries
[source,bash]
----
* soft memlock 30000000
* hard memlock 30000000
----

.Clone MachineKit
----
----

In a root terminal

*cd /usr/src*

*git clone https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit.git machinekit*

When complete

*chown -R yourusername:yourusername ./machinekit*

Then close the root terminal and open a normal one


.After cloning MachineKit and before building
----
----

MachineKit uses rsyslog to log errors, making debugging in case of problems much easier.
This needs to be enabled, if you do not do so you will get an error at the end of the build.

*sudo touch /var/log/linuxcnc.log*

*sudo chmod 644 /var/log/linuxcnc.log*

*sudo cp /usr/src/macinekit/src/rtapi/rsyslogd-linuxcnc.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/linuxcnc.conf*

*sudo chmod 644 /etc/rsyslog.d/linuxcnc.conf*

*sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart*

.Building MachineKit
----
----

The later kernel based distros, Debian 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 included, changed the set up inside /usr/include

This will prevent Machinekit building unless you make a few changes

From a file manager go to /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu

Now copy all the folders and loose header back to the root dir
ie.

*/asm /bits /gnu /sys a.out.h fpu_control.h ieee754.h*

Now we are ready to build

*cd /usr/src/machinekit/src*

*./autogen.sh*

*./configure*

Now scroll back and read the output to screen

It should contain these lines

        checking for configured kernel source in /usr/src/linux-3.5.7... found
        checking if /usr/src/linux-3.5.7 is a xenomai kernel... no
        checking if /usr/src/linux-3.5.7 is an RTAI kernel... yes
        checking -lrt for RT_PREEMPT and POSIX... ok
        checking whether to build POSIX threads... yes
        checking whether to build RT_PREEMPT threads... yes
        checking for xeno-config... no
        checking usability of xenomai utility, 0... no
        checking whether to build Xenomai userland threads... no
        checking whether to build Xenomai kernel threads... no
        checking for rtai-config... /usr/realtime/bin/rtai-config
        checking usability of RTAI utility, /usr/realtime/bin/rtai-config... yes
        checking whether to build RTAI threads... yes
        checking whether to build hardware drivers... yes
        
That shows the rtai kernel is detected, the realtime config points to the right place and RTAI threads will be built

Now the final build commands

*make*

*sudo make setuid && cd ../ && . ./scripts/rip-environment*

It's not called machinekit yet, so

*linuxcnc*

and you are away!


.Additional Notes
----
----

.Realtek RTL8111/RTL8168 ethernet
----
----

Some versions of this chip can cause huge problems when used with the r8169 module which is supplied with the 3.5.7 kernel

If ethernet works at all it, it is either hugely degraded in speed or intermitant and the kernel may be unstable

If you have this chipset it will show up with 

*lspci -vv | more*

Page through the output looking for 'Ethernet Controller: Realtek ....'

At the bottom of the entry is

Kernel Driver in use:   xxxxx

If the driver is listed as r8169, you need to replace it with the r8168 driver

There is a directory called r8168-8.035.00 in the cloned git repo you made at /usr/src/sources

That contains a README file with instructions to build the driver, blacklist r8169 and insert the module and log it with depmod

It is vitally important that you must now re-run the ramfs image creating program to include the module

*sudo update-initramfs -t -c -k 3.5.7-rtai*

and then re-boot into the 3.5.7-rtai kernel before anything will take effect
