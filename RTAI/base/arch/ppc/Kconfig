#	# default y
#	default n
#	help
#	RTAI dispatches real time interrupts immediately to achieve as
#	low a overhead as possible. Very important on low end CPUs. By
#	setting this option it is possible to achieve a further improvement
#	by allowing hard RTAI internal timers and SMP interprocessor
#	scheduling interrupts to be vectored directly to their handlers,

	The FPU executes instructions from the processor's normal

	may greatly improve performances.  You can obtain more

config RTAI_RTC_FREQ
	string "Set RTC clock tick frequency and use RTC as the only timer"
	default 0
	help
	1 - Are you happy of working in periodic mode?
	2 - If so, is it accepable to resolve your timing needs with a
	    tick within a frequency that can be varied just in powers of
	    2, from 2 to 8192 Hz?
	If both your answers are YES than it might be worth setting your
	tick frequency of choice here and let RTAI schedulers work with
	it using the Real Time Clock (RTC). Be careful though as:
	- you must not have configured the RTC as available to Linux;
	- RTC will be the only available timer and its tick frequency
	  can be modified only here, so you must reconfigure this param
	  to change it, setting it to zero to return using the other
	  RTAI timers.
	The main advantage of using the RTC, if constraints 1 and 2 can be
	accepted, is that you will not touch any of the hard timing sources
	used by Linux (8254 especially and APIC too). In fact if an APIC
	timer is available (SMP and recent machines) it is possible to avoid
	the most important interference with Linux timing by not using the
	8254. However such a possibilty is not available on low end CPUs
	and embedded systems for which the only way to avoid interfering with
	the Linux timer might be this option. Thus in such cases, 1-2 above
	being acceptable once more, setting this config param might be a
	good choice.

config RTAI_SCHED_8254_LATENCY
	string "8254 tuning latency (ns)"
	default 4700
	help
	The anticipation time to be used to program the hard timer, in oneshot
	mode, for the next scheduling shot in order to compensate for the
	programming overhead needed to determine the right firing time.
	This parameter has no effect when the periodic mode is used.

#config RTAI_LXRT_USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
#	bool "Use Linux syscall mechanism for RTAI calls from user space"
#	# to be restored later?
#	# default n
#	default y
#	help
#	With this option enabled, RTAI uses the Linux syscall mechanism
#	for its service calls, including RTAI own srqs, as provided by libc
#	"syscall".  This may improve signal handling (and therefore debugging
#	of RTAI applications), but has the drawback of a slight overhead.
#
#	When direct inlining of RTAI syscalls is enabled, see the related
#	configuration options, it is still possible to force the use of
#	the Linux syscall mechanism, even if this configuration parameter
#	has not been set. Notice that RTAI own srqs are inlined always.
#	So, since it all depends on the definition of the USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
#	macro, the only thing to do is to add:
#	#define USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
#	after all of the RTAI headers inclusion in any source file in which
#	you want to use the Linux syscall mechanism, to be sure that the macro
#	USE_LINUX_SYSCALL will not be redifined afterward. In the same way
#	when this parameter is set you can selectively revert to RTAI own
#	syscall mechanism by defining:
#	#undef USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
#	after all of the RTAI headers inclusion in any source file in which
#	you want to use the LXRT syscall mechanism.
#	RTAI will then operate in mixed mode selectively by using both
#	its own and Linux syscall mechanisms.
#
#	If in doubt, say no.

	help
	This RTAI specific module allows sharing memory inter-intra
	real-time tasks and Linux processes. In fact it can be an
	alternative to the SYSTEM V shared memory. It may also be
	noticed that the services are symmetrical, i.e. the same calls
	can be used both in real-time tasks (within the kernel) and
	Linux processes.

config RTAI_IMMEDIATE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	bool "Immediate Linux syscall in hard real time"
	default n
	help
	This parameter allows to control RTAI behaviour when a Linux syscall
	is made while in hard real time, according to the following two ways:
	- 1) 	- if it is set RTAI will put the task back into Linux hands,
		  i.e pass it to soft mode;
		- call the related sys service immediately, i.e. without
		  going through the Linux syscall path;
		- put the task back to hard real time, so that it will return
		  to user space in hard real time mode again.
	- 2) 	- if it is not set RTAI will put the task back into Linux hands,
		  i.e pass it to soft mode;
		- call the related sys service through the Linux syscall path;
		- return to user space in soft real time mode;
		- resume hard real time at the next call of an RTAI function.
	The most efficient behaviour is 1 but 2 can be useful in relation to
	specific RTAI users extensions.
	It is remarked that nothing is changed if hard/soft transitions
	are called controlled by an application task through
	rt_make_hard_real_time/rt_make_soft_real_time.

config RTAI_TRACE
	bool "LTT support"
	default n
	help
	Originally, the Linux Trace Toolkit is a suite of tools
	designed to extract program execution details from the Linux
	operating system and interpret them. Specifically, it enables
	to extract processor utilization and allocation information
	for a certain period of time. It is then possible to perform
	various calculations on this data and dump this in a text
	file. This tool is enhanced by a GTK GUI which allows an easy
	exploitation of those results.  The Linux Trace Toolkit has
	been natively integrated into RTAI modules.
