****** COORDINATION OF KERNEL/USER SPACE TASKS EXAMPLE ******

This test uses a periodic agent kernel real time task that, after
having done its work, actually nothing, relay data sent to him through
shared memory by a sender Linux process to a receiver Linux
processes. The sender is synchronized to the agent real time task by
using semaphores, while the receiver uses intertask messages. There
are two macros to be cared of: TICK_PERIOD in agent.c, to determine
the ticking, COUNT in sender.c, to define the number of times to
repeat the test. It should be matched to TICK_PERIOD as the product of
the too is roughly the time spent to run the test.
