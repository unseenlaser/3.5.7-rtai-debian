Another RTDM test ported to RTAI.

Check the parameter in the "run" script before using it.

To use it:
- make
- ./run 0  // something like RTAI latency in user space
- ./run 1  // something like RTAI latency in kern space
- ./run 2  // something like RTAI tasklets timers in kern space
- Ctrl-C to end anything

It's possible to run multiple instances.

To know more about execution options:
- ./run
then edit the "run" script accordingly;
Alternatively execute it your own way.
