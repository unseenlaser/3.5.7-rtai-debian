****** THREADS EXAMPLE ******

This example verifies core timing operations in soft and hard real
time modes of many tasks launched through pthrad_create; number of
tasks, timing and durations controlled by macros in period.h.  The
possibility of using pthread_create to generate Linux processes is
very usefull since it allows a task layout that is close to the
structure of modules.  That could make it easier the translation to
kernel modules for maximum performances.  Under computer load check
jitters printed at the end, even tasks run in hard mode, odd ones in
soft mode.

See the companion example "forked" for a demonstration on how to use
"fork" for separate coordinated processes execution.
