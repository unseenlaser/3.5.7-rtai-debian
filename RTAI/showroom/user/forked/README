****** FORKED EXAMPLE ******

This example shows common operations in soft and hard real time mode
of many tasks launched through forking; number of tasks, timing and
durations controlled by macros in period.h.  Under computer load check
jitters printed at the end, even tasks run in hard mode, odd ones in
soft mode.

See the companion example "threaded" for a demonstration on how to use
"pthread_create" for separate coordinated processes execution.
