This test uses a timer interrupt to emulate interrupts caused by an encoder that
is measuring something. When the encoder count reaches a certain value,
indicating the end of the work to be done on a certain item, it is reset and a
new item is worked upon, till a user assigned number of items, or Ctrl-C.
The emulated encoder interrupts are catched by a kernel handler that signals
a semaphore to wake up a hard real time user space thread that does all the
interrupt handling, while a standard supervisor Linux process manages the user
interface.
Note that the only meaningfull thing the handler does is an rt_sem_signal.
Emulated encoder interrupts are flooded at 20 khz to user space and you can
check that none is lost, even under heavy forground Linux load, by watching
the encoder max count displayed against the its max allowed value.
