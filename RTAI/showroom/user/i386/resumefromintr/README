This test shows two ways for waking up user space hard real time processes
directly from interrupt handlers. The process itself can then act, partly or
as a whole, as an interrupt handler. Do not confuse it with bottom halves,
it is better, more direct, effective and true real time. It is based on using
either suspend/resume or semaphore wait/signal.

You can control period, duration and wakeup method through macros in period.h.

To run the example, type:

$ make run
