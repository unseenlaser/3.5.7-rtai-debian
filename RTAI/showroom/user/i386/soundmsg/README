The running of this test is self contained. Nonetheless you need to have
compiled and installed: rtai.c and a scheduler appropriate to your PC.
To have them all available just follow the usual RTAI installation procedure,
do "make all" and then install the needed scheduler.
Note that "make clean"s are repeated just to make it safe, please do them at
least once after installing. There is the possibility of doing it all at once
from within directory "newlxrt" by: "making cleanall", just to be sure, followed
by "make all".

This sound test mimics the one already used in RTAI examples and in LXRT,
executing an endless loop till you type CTRL-C. The only difference with those
example being that it is implemented by using RTAI specific extended intertask
messaging in place of a communication mailbox.

To run it:
make clean
make
./run
ENTER to stop
