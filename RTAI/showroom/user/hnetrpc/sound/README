This test shows the use of RTAI distributed processing in user space.
It implements the sound example, found both in kernel space examples and in
LXRT, on one/two machines. So you can have it played everywhere under control
of a remote process. The sound track is passed between tasks by using a mailbox.
See example usoundmsg for an implementation based on extended RTAI messages.

To run it on a single machine do:

make
./run
./rem, after ending it by pressing ENTER.

To run it on different machines comment out the line executing the process to
be run on onother node, in file run, and set the appropriate dotted decimal
notation IP address of the speaker task on its command line.
