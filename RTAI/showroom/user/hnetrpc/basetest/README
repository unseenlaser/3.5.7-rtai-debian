This test shows the use of RTAI distributed processing in user space.
It is based on the "jepplin" test found in the kernel examples of RTAI.
It has been chosen because it features semaphores and mail boxes, plain and
timed out, thus allowing to verify all the basic requirements of a distributed
application. It is implemented in a form that allows its distribution to three
decentralised remote units, one of which affords just a centralised timer and
all the needed semaphores and mailboxes, while not carrying out any processing.
The 3 units can then work on a 1/2/3 different computers.
See the corresponding implementation in kernel space in directory ktest.

To run it on a single machine do:

make
./run
./rem, when it ends.

To run it on different machines comment out the lines executing processes to be
run on other nodes, in file run, and set the appropriate dotted decimal notation
IP addresses on the command line of each process.
