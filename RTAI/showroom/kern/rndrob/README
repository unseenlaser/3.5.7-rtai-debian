****** ROUND ROBIN (RR) SCHEDULING EXAMPLE ******

This example demonstrates RR scheduling. It features NTASKS realtime tasks each
running to increase a counter for the same total absolute time, without
releasing the CPU. The final printout of all of the counters will show that they
all worked in slices because of the RR policy. A counterproof can be seen by
setting the variable SchedPolicy to RT_SCHED_FIFO, either manually or by
insmoding with "SchedPolicy=0"
Various macros in rt_process allows to experiment the use of different
parameters values, i.e.: number of tasks, RR quantum, execution time.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

To remove it type:

./rem
