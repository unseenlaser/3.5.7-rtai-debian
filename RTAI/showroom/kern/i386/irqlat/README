This is example shows raw irq latencies due just to your hardware.
In fact there is nothing of RTAI in it. Even if you have to load rtai_hal
the checked interrupt, 8254 timer, is handled directly at the descriptor
table level only.
So if they are too high there is nothing RTAI can do for you.
You should try the SMI helper or play with BIOS and Linux configs.
