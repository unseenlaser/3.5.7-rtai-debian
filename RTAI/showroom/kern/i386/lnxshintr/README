****** SHARED LEVEL INTERRUPTS ******

This example shows how level triggered interrupts could be shared between real
and non real time applications.

It must be noted that such a sharing should be avoided as far as possible.
In fact the related PIC interrupt cannot be enabled till all the shared
interrupts are processed and so it might end with the real time ones having
to wait Linux.

That said it is here, at least is yet another good test for the core RTAI stuff.

It uses the ethernet interrupt number of the machine on which it has been
tested first. It is defined through the static variable ETHIRQ. You might have
to change it or insmod with "ETHIRQ=myirq".

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

To stop it type enter.
