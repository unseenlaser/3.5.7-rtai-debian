****** MBX EXAMPLE ******

This example demonstrates the use of RTAI mailboxes.
It has two senders and one receiver that exchange messages on mailboxes.
Just run it for some time, if nothing appears on the screen than it is OK.
See the code to understand why.

To use it just type:

make
./run

To stop it type:

./rem

Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.
