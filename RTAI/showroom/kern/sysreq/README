****** SYSREQ EXAMPLE ******

This directory shows how you can use the module rtai to install an
interrupt handler to simulate a higher tick for a Linux process communicating
with RTAI by using full two way rtai system requests. It is similar to
rt_process2 in fastick directory but does not need to use fifos.
Since rtai does just a few things per tick you can run this at very high rates
without killing your machine, for just a few tasks that need a tighter timing.
The new ticking is determined by the macro TICK in rt_process.c.

To run it do:

make
./run
