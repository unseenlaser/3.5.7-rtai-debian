****** EDF EXAMPLE ******

This example features NTASKS realtime tasks running periodically in EDF mode.
The task are given a priority ordered in such a way that low numbered tasks
have the lowest priority. However the tasks execute for a duration proportional
to their number so that, under EDF, the lowest priority tasks run first.
So if they appear increasingly ordered on the screen EDF should be working.

To run the example, type:

$ make run
