****** MSG_CLOCK EXAMPLE ******

This example demonstrates the use of messages in a MUP scheduler.
It is mainly aimed at verifying that such a technique of intercpus
synchronizations works in a MUP application. On dual MP it seems to work
correctly for any combination of timers. But we did not test for a too long
time.

It implements a digital wrist clock in the way detailed in: Andre' Schiper,
Programmation Concurrent, Presses Polytechnique et Universitaires, Geneve.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

then follow the menu.
