****** FASTICK EXAMPLE ******

This directory shows how you can use the module rtai to install
either a real time task (rt_process1)
or an interrupt handler (rt_process2)
to simulate a higher tick for a task communicating with them through a fifo.
Since rtai does just a few things per tick you can run this at very high rates
without killing your machine, for just a few tasks that need a tighter timing.
(From a suggestion by Steve Papacharalambous)
->>>>> Note that the interrupt handler runs just
	with rtai and rtai_fifos modules installed.
The new ticking is determined by the macro TICK in rt_process?.c.
If you use rt_process2.c recall to set the
value of the macro APIC_TIMER in it to 1 if you can and want use the local APIC,
otherwise to 0 to use the 8254 (for UP-kernel configuration the default is 0).

To run it do:
make
./run_?
Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.
