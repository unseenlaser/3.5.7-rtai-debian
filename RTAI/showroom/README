RTAI examples for 3.x

Its aim is to avoid bloating the main RTAI development thread while
keeping valuable examples for users and for testing newly RTAI
developed features.

In order to compile examples from the showroom, you have to add
$prefix/bin to your PATH variable, with $prefix pointing to RTAI's
installation root (by default, prefix = /usr/realtime), so that the
rtai-config utility can be found by the various Makefiles.

Then the usage is quite simple, i.e. in each directory:
make-run-rem-make clean. There is also a Makefile at each top branch
directory, obviously without the possibility of any "run". Instead you
could run "test_suite", though they are mostly for quick testing by
developers, so use them with care and due timing between each
execution.
