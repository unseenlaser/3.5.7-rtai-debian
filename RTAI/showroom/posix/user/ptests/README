BARRIERS
// changes to RTAI parent APIs:
//	1 - return -1 for tasks blocked by the barrier.
tst-barrier1.c: OK

MUTEXES
// changes to RTAI parent APIs:
//	1 - do not let unlocking of RES_SEM, either by non owner or by
//	    owner if unlocked already.
//	2 - what needed to support error checking for non recursive RES_SEMs,
//          RTAI had recursive RES_SEMs only.

RWLOCKS
// changes to RTAI parent APIs:
//	1 - a fix of the returned value of rt_rwl_delete
//	2 - RTAI rwl can now be typed so that wrlocks can be: recursive,
	    error checking, normal. This feature has served for testing
	    and migh be ready for use in future Posix specs (as anticipated
	    by NPTL).
