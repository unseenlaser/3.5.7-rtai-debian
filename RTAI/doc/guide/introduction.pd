Introduction
============

RTAI uses the world's fastest Real-time + Linux combination, featuring
real-time interrupts that are dispatched immediately.
An exclusive feature to the x86 32-bit architecture is that it has the
potential of completely avoiding the dispatching of critical
internal timers and interprocessor scheduling interrupts by vectoring them
directly to their handlers. This option heavily increases
real-time performances on a variety of machines and comes by default,
however it can easily be disabled using the ncurses menuconfig interface.

In order to use the above features, you must be already running an
RTAI (Real-time Application Interface) patched Linux kernel with
IPIPE (Interrupt Pileline) enabled.

Please note that only x86-based (32-bit and x86_64) architectures
have been tested with this branch. x86_64 support is still a work in progress
with the 3.x kernel series, but is a high priority.
